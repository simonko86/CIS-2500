*************************

**********
Compilation
**********

Compile with gcc src/main.c src/rogueGame.c src/parse.c src/draw.c -std=c99 -Iinclude -Wall -lncurses

OR

Use makefile, by compiling with "make" in the terminal

**********
Running the Program(s)
**********

Run with ./a.out assets/room.txt

**********
Testing
**********

The cursor cannot escape the walls except on into doors
When moving from door to door, the game checks if there is a North door as a priority. Then the South, West and East doors. If there is no door for that room, the hero moves back to the first room.
Too many of 1 item, moves that item into the next member in the struct
Too many levels in the data file causes a seg fault.
If an item is outside the room, the item is still printed

**********
Known Limitations
**********

The weak monsters are all the same in the game, but they are random when you start the game
Caps lock means nothing happens, even when pressing 'A', 'S', 'D', 'W' and 'Q'
Pressing another button except a,w,s,d and q causes the cursor to look like a '.', but when moved, the '@',hero, moves like normal

References
